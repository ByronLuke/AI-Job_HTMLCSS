                <h6>Programming</h6>
                <p>Developing a strong knowledge of programming languages is crucial for AI careers, including roles
                    like machine learning engineer, algorithm developer, computer vision engineer, and SLAM engineer.
                    Understanding languages such as Python, Java, Apache Spark, and tools like Python 3 and Pandas is
                    essential. Practical programming experience through modules focused on designing, implementing,
                    testing, and documenting programs is invaluable.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h6>Database Modelling, Data Warehousing, and Data Processing</h6>
                <p>
                    AI experts must manage and manipulate large amounts of data efficiently. Skills in current database
                    technology, designing and manipulating databases with relational algebra and SQL, and an
                    appreciation of non-traditional data types like NoSQL databases are highly sought after. Hands-on
                    practice in these areas ensures that AI systems can effectively leverage data.

                    Machine Learning
                </h6>
                <p>
                    Machine learning enables machines to perform tasks intelligently without explicit programming. AI
                    professionals, especially those aiming to be machine learning engineers, need to understand
                    fundamental machine learning theories, current techniques, research advances, and optimization
                    algorithms for training neural networks. Proficiency in both supervised and unsupervised learning,
                    as well as shallow and deep learning techniques, is critical.

            </div>

            <div>
                <h6>Knowledge of Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI)</h6>
                <p>AI professionals are challenged to design interactive systems with intelligent interfaces, such as
                    voice recognition or touch-screen controls. Skills in prototyping, evaluating IUI designs, and
                    exploring various technologies for secure systems, vehicle automation, smart homes, and smart cities
                    are essential. Understanding human factors in system interactions is key to creating effective IUIs.

            <div>
                <h6>Problem Solving</h6>
                <p>
                    AI and computer science are fundamentally about solving problems, from coding challenges to finding
                    automated solutions for global issues. Developing analytical skills through practice and independent
                    research projects, such as a dissertation, helps hone problem-solving capabilities. This skill is
                    crucial regardless of the specific AI career path chosen.
